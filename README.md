# Building a Recommender System From Scratch with Matrix Factorization in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a recommender system from scratch using matrix factorization techniques in Python. Recommender systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and various applications to provide personalized recommendations to users.

## Features
- Implementation of collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction
- Performance evaluation using RMSE and other metrics
- Dataset preprocessing and handling missing values
- Visualization of recommendations and user-item interactions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trishita-26/Building-a-Recommender-System-From-Scratch-with-Matrix-Factorization-in-Python.git
   cd Building-a-Recommender-System-From-Scratch-with-Matrix-Factorization-in-Python
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate the recommender system:
```bash
python recommender.py
```

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset (such as MovieLens). Make sure to download and place it in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Results
- RMSE and accuracy of predictions
- Recommendations generated for specific users
- Visualization of latent features

## Future Improvements
- Implementing additional matrix factorization techniques
- Incorporating deep learning for hybrid recommendations
- Optimizing hyperparameters for better performance
